# Bytewatch Stremio Addon

A Node.js-powered Stremio addon that scrapes multiple streaming sites using Puppeteer. It integrates them into the Stremio ecosystem through a single stream handler.

---

## Features

- Scrapes multiple providers from a single file
- Real browser scraping via `puppeteer-real-browser`
- Stremio addon-compatible manifest & stream handler
- Caching using `node-cache`
- Logging using `winston`

## Notes

- All scrapers are defined in `unified-extractor.js`.
- Logs will print to console using Winston (with timestamp and levels).
- Caching is in-memory using `node-cache` to improve performance and avoid repeat scraping.
- Puppeteer requires a headless-compatible environment â€” avoid deploying on memory-constrained VMs without swap.
